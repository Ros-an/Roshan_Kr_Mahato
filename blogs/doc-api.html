            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>There are lots of other blogpost about API, but this one is
                little different, here I won't be talking about technical details, here I'll only talk about "what it
                is", not how it works, means here we'll only understand what is API. </p>

            <h2>Let's talk</h2>
            <p><strong> API </strong> - each of these word has a meaning.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Application</strong> means a piece of software that does a task. For example - Flipkart has a
                software that sells you an items, Google music player plays music, Skype provides you conversation and
                google provides you search results, etc etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Programming</strong> is the program that does task within the application. For example - Google
                music player application uses a program to play music for you, you've to run a program to play a music
                program to play music for you.</p>

            <p><strong>Interface</strong> is a place where you tell that program to run within that application.
                For example - on your cell phone you've apps and each of these apps is actually an interface.
            </p>
            <p>Say I've the google translator app(GTA), the GTA is my interface and say I put in a word and wants it to
                be translated in Hindi, then the word gets send to the program in a google server somewhere and that
                program sends me back the translated word. Similar is the map app that provides me with direction, when
                I click on this app I use this map app interface. When I click this interface it tells a program to run
                in the map piece of software and that program will give me back directions. Each one of this app
                you use in cell phones is actually an API interface. So interface is a place where you tell your program
                to run. These were the example of API in cell phone. <br>Now for computer API lets take "Google search"
                as an example, you have the interface that is the google search page, now from google search page you
                tell google to run a program(by pressing search) which does the search for you and provide you back the
                webpage with results, so API's are everywhere</p>
            <p>You can even think of API as IPA that is the other way around, you start with the interface and at the
                interface(I) is where you tell a program(P) to run in an application(A).</p>

            <h2>Advantage are</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You don't have to write the program, you just use available one.</li>
                <li>It's platform independent means you can run this interface from anywhere.</li>
            </ul>
