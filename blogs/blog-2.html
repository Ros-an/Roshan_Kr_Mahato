            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This topic is all about what is html, css and javascript, here I'll discuss about these web technologies
                with analogy.</p>
            <h2>let's start</h2>
            <p><strong>HTML</strong> code file is responsible for the structure of you website. <br>So if a website was
                a house, then the HTML would be the builder who would come in to build the walls, put in a bathroom,
                toilet. Basically, they establish the structure of your house, and similarly when you write HTML code
                you also build up the structure of your website where you use image, button or text box and many more
                you need for your website. </p>

            <p><strong>CSS</strong> is responsible for styling your websites.If you were building a house, then CSS
                would be painters and decorators who paints the wall or add stylistics things to your place making the
                place
                look the way you want it to and that's exactly what CSS code does as well. <br>
                When you incorporate CSS, it allows you to specify how you want your website to look, like wanting the
                button to be of green color, changing the font-family and all.</p>

            <p>Now the final one is - <br><strong>JavaScript</strong> so what is the role of javascript in websites?
                Javascript code file allows your website to have behaviour(function). If you were building a house, you
                would have electrician come in who would be able to connect the wires so that you can switch on your
                light bulbs or plumber would come in so that your toilet can flush or making water tap work(this light
                bulb
                on-off,or water out of tap are all function) and thats exactly what JS does, it adds
                behaviour/functionality to your website like image slide, autocomplete and many more. </p>
